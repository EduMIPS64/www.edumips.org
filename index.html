<p>Welcome to the home page of 
<span class="edumips">EduMIPS<span>64</span></span>,
a free (as in free speech) visual and cross-platform MIPS64 CPU Simulator.</p>

<p>The simulator was written in order to support Computer Architecture students with a free and cross-platform tool that allows them to run programs written in the MIPS64 assembly dialect and see how the CPU behaves during the execution, experimenting with various aspects of low-level programming that they learn throughout the course.</p>

<p>EduMIPS64 started as a <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> Java port of <a
  href="http://indigo.ie/%7Emscott/">WinMIPS64</a>, a Windows-only MIPS64
simulator, but independently evolved soon after into a stand-alone open source
application.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
          The development of the simulator started in 2006, when a group of
          students from the University of Catania decided that they didn't
          want to be tied to the Windows operating system to complete their
          Computer Architecture assignments. Also, writing a CPU simulator
          from scratch sounded fun!
          </p>

          <p>
          Most of the features were implemented in 2006, and after that only a
          handful of developers kept adding features in 2007 and 2008. From
          2008 on, the simulator has been maintained by 
          <a href="https://github.com/lupino3">lupino3</a>, one of the
          founders of the project.

          offers a bit of history, but unfortunately the bulk of the
          development (prior to 0.0.7) was not recorded as it happened via
          email using lupino3 as a human VCS.
