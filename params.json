{"name":"EduMIPS64","tagline":"Free cross-platform educational MIPS64 CPU Simulator","body":"## Welcome!\r\n\r\nWelcome to the home page of EduMIPS64, a free (as in free speech) visual and cross-platform MIPS64 CPU Simulator.\r\n\r\nThe simulator was written in order to support Computer Architecture students with a free and cross-platform tool that allows them to run programs written in the MIPS64 assembly dialect and see how the CPU behaves during the execution, experimenting with various aspects of low-level programming that they learn throughout the course.\r\n\r\nEduMIPS64 started as a [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) Java port of [WinMIPS64](http://indigo.ie/~mscott/), a Windows-only MIPS64 simulator, but independently evolved soon after into a stand-alone open source MIPS64 simulator.","google":"UA-56557176-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
